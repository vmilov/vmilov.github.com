<p> Hi, I am Vadim Milov, a chess grandmaster from Switzerland. My peak rating up till now was 2705 (2008). My highest world ranking was 22 (2004).</p>

<h3>Chess Instruction</h3>

<p>Chess is a hard game combining sport, science and art. Improving at chess requires hard work, perseverance and creativity.  I
  can guide you but the main work has to be done by yourself. I usually start with a student's games. After identifying strong sides and mistake patterns, it's time to decide what problems to solve and books to study.</p>

<h3>Chess Lessons</h3>

<p>I offer chess lessons on ICC, Playchess or skype. My rate over the internet is $50 an hour. Lessons can be conducted in English, German, or Russian. After a lesson, I normally provide a set of exercises and further things to work on.
</p>

	My email is vadimmilov (at) hotmail.com.  My handle on ICC is v-milov.
