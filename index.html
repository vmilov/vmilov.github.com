<p>Hi, I am Vadim Milov, a chess grandmaster from Switzerland. My peak rating was 2705 (with a world ranking of 22). I can speak English, Russian, and German. </p>

<h3>Chess Instruction</h3>

<p>Chess is a hard game combining sport, science and art. Improving at chess requires hard work, perseverance and creativity.  I
  can guide you but the main work has to be done by yourself. I usually start with a student's tournament games. It is important to study those games and identify typical mistakes. After identifying mistake patterns, it's time to decide what material to review, problems to solve, and books to study. </p>

<h3>Chess Lessons</h3>

<p>I offer chess lessons on ICC and playchess. My rate is $50 an hour. I conduct lessons via skype so that we can talk and move pieces simultaneously. Lessons can be conducted in english, german, or russian. After a lesson, I provide a set of exercises if requested.
</p>

	My email is vadimmilov (at) hotmail.com.  My handle on ICC is v-milov.
