        <h3>Profile</h3>

<p>Hi, I am Vadim Milov from Switzerland. I am a chess grandmaster. My peak rating was 2705. My highest world ranking was 22nd. I can speak English, Russian, German, and some Hebrew. Outside of chess, I enjoy researching the stock market and reading books on philosophy. </p>

<h3>Chess Instruction</h3>

<p>Chess is a hard game combining sport, science and art. Improving at chess requires hard work, perseverance and creativity. Most players can reach master level with hard work and perseverance. I
  can guide students well but one still needs to put in a lot of effort. I am thus looking for serious students. I usually start with a student's tournament games. It is important to study those games and identify typical mistakes. After identifying mistake patterns, it's time to decide what material to review, problems to solve, and books to study. </p>

<h3>Chess Lessons</h3>

<p>I offer chess lessons on ICC and playchess. My handle on ICC is v-milov. My rate is $75 an hour. I conduct lessons via skype so that we can talk and move pieces simultaneously. After a lesson, I provide a set of exercises if requested.</p>
